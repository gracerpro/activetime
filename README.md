Store the active, passive and sleep time. *Active time* represents
the time when user work on computer (play in the games, edit
the document etc.), *passive time* represents the time when user don't work
on computer (away from keyboard, sees the films etc.), *sleep time* represents
time when computer is in sleep mode.

*Divided time* -- time when begin next worked day. For me it is 03:00.
